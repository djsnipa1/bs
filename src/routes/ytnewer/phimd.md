To achieve the effect of displaying a YouTube video at full viewport height on mobile devices while maintaining a 16:9 aspect ratio, you can use Tailwind CSS's utility classes along with some custom CSS to ensure the video covers the entire viewport height and width, cropping the sides if necessary. Since you're using SvelteKit and Tailwind CSS, here's a step-by-step guide to achieve this:

1. **Ensure Tailwind CSS is Set Up in Your SvelteKit Project**: If you haven't already, follow the instructions from the Tailwind CSS documentation to set up Tailwind CSS in your SvelteKit project. This involves installing Tailwind CSS and its dependencies, generating the `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js` files, and configuring your `svelte.config.js` to use PostCSS [1].

2. **Use Tailwind CSS for Basic Styling**: Utilize Tailwind's utility classes for basic styling. For example, you can use `h-screen` to make an element span the entire height of the viewport [4].

3. **Custom CSS for Aspect Ratio and Cover**: Since Tailwind CSS doesn't directly support the `object-fit: cover;` property for videos, you'll need to write some custom CSS. You can use the `@apply` directive in your Tailwind CSS file to apply utility classes to your custom CSS. For example, to ensure the video covers the entire viewport height and maintains a 16:9 aspect ratio, you might write something like this in your global CSS file:

```css
/* In your global CSS file, e.g., app.css */
.video-container {
	@apply relative h-screen w-full;
}

.video-container iframe {
	@apply absolute left-0 top-0 h-full w-full;
	object-fit: cover;
}
```

4.  **HTML Structure**: In your Svelte component, structure your HTML to include the video within a container that uses the custom CSS classes you've defined. Here's an example:

```html
<div class="video-container">
	<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
```

    5. **Responsive Design**: To ensure this layout only applies to mobile devices, you can use Tailwind's responsive design utilities. For example, you might only want the video to cover the entire viewport on small screens and below. You can adjust the `video-container` class to only apply these styles on smaller screens:

```css
/* Adjust the video-container class for smaller screens */
@media (max-width: 640px) {
	.video-container {
		@apply relative h-screen w-full;
	}

	.video-container iframe {
		@apply absolute left-0 top-0 h-full w-full;
		object-fit: cover;
	}
}
```

This approach combines Tailwind CSS's utility classes with custom CSS to achieve the desired effect of displaying a YouTube video at full viewport height on mobile devices while maintaining a 16:9 aspect ratio. Remember to replace `VIDEO_ID` with the actual ID of the YouTube video you want to display.
